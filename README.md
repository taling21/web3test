In my code , the first class is the 'bank' - and it has 'lender' as its child. The various lenders are the objects of this 'lender' class. The borrower will be an object of the 'borrower' class. The 'bank' class is an abstract one,so it can't be instantiated  directly. The program takes the name of the borrower and money requirement as input, and returns the "most suitable lender". The most suitable lender is the one with sufficient money to lend, at the lowest rate of interest. 
The algorithm to decide the suitable lender is : out of the List of lenders, put those in a dictionary which are eligible, then find the minimum value in the dictionary. The dictionary here, is an object of my_dictionary class.
To run the code, compile and execute the code on a suitable platform , and input the name and money required. The details of the most suitable lender will be displayed.
